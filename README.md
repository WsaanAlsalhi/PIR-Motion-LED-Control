# PIR-Motion-LED-Control

This is a simple Arduino project that uses a PIR motion sensor to detect movement and control an LED. When motion is detected, the LED turns on for 5 seconds and then turns off.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Board**
- **PIR Motion Sensor**
- **LED**
- **Resistor (220Ω)**
- **Jumper Wires**

## How It Works
1. The PIR sensor detects motion.
2. The Arduino reads the sensor’s state.
3. If motion is detected, the LED turns on for 5 seconds.
4. The system resets and continues monitoring.

## Installation
Upload the provided code to your Arduino using the **Arduino IDE** and connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram.
